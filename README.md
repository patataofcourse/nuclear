# nuclear
Python library and CLI for Nintendo DS image formats, based off ndspy.

## Requirements
* Python **3.10 or higher**
* ndspy (not used yet but will be necessary in the future)

## How to use
1. Make a folder named `test_files`
2. Put a NCLR file called backbeat.NCLR inside
3. `python main.py`
4. Profit

## Progress
Currently this isn't very advanced, the only thing it can do is open palette files and it still breaks lmao
